	<h3>In Thai alphabets: ภัทร สุขประเสริฐ</h3>
	<p>
		I am a third year CS PhD student at <a href="https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a>.
		I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/samir/">Prof. Samir Khuller</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am interested in combinatorial optimization, approximation algorithms, and graph theory. <br>
		I have worked on network design problems, network flow problems, 
		and some structural graph theory problems. 
		Recently, I have also developed some interests in fast (up to sub-cubic) approximation algorithms.

    During Spring'20, I'll be a TA for <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/compsci336sp20/">CS336</a>.
